# My First React Project

This is my very first application built with **React** ðŸŽ‰.  
I am just getting started with this framework, and this project is an important step to learn and improve my front-end development skills.

## Goals

- Learn the basics of React (components, props, state).  
- Understand how to structure a React application.  
- Practice using the development environment powered by **Vite**.  

## Installation & Run

1. Clone the project:  
   ```bash
   git clone <project-url>
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Notes

* This project is mainly an **exercise for learning purposes**.
* I will keep improving it as I progress in my React journey.
